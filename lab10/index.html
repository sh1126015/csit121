            <h2>1).What is XML?</h2>
            <p> &bull; XML, or eXtensible Markup Language, is a type of code used to organize and label information in a document in a way that both humans and computers can read easily. It is designed to be simple and flexible, allowing it to be used widely on the Internet for various purposes. The main idea behind XML is to make information sharing easier and clearer, especially over the web.</p>

            <h2>2).How is XML used?</h2>
            <p>&bull;XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is widely used across different fields of technology and web development for its flexibility and ability to facilitate easy data interchange between systems. It is commonly employed in web services such as SOAP and REST for messaging and sharing data seamlessly between different software applications. XML is also essential for configuring application settings through readable and editable configuration files. Additionally, it underpins various document formats, including those used in Microsoft Office, allowing for detailed document structuring and management. In the realm of online publishing, XML supports content syndication through technologies like RSS feeds, enabling automatic content updates across diverse platforms. This versatility makes XML a crucial tool in areas ranging from scientific research to financial services, where structured data management and accuracy are paramount.</p>

            <h2>3).What does XML look like? (provide an example)</h2>
            <p>&bull; Here is the actual example how XML looks:</p>
            <pre>
            <code>
                &lt;note&gt;<br>
                    &lt;to&gt;Team&lt;/to&gt;<br>
                    &lt;from&gt;Manager&lt;/from&gt;<br>
                    &lt;heading&gt;Project &lt;/heading&gt;<br>
                    &lt;body&gt;Please review the updated project schedule by EOD&lt;/body&gt;<br>
                &lt;/note&gt;
            </code>
            </pre>

            <h2>4).What is JavaScript?</h2>
            <p>&bull; JavaScript is a powerful, high-level programming language that is widely used to create dynamic and interactive effects within web browsers. As a core technology of the web alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript enables developers to implement complex features on web pagesâ€”from image sliders and interactive forms to complex game mechanics and real-time data updates. JavaScript runs on the client side of the web, which allows scripts to respond quickly to user interactions without needing to communicate with the server for every action.</p>


            <h2>5).How is JavaScript related to HTML and CSS?</h2>
            <p>&bull; JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are integral to web development, where HTML sets up the structure of web pages, CSS styles and layouts the elements, and JavaScript adds interactivity. HTML forms the backbone by defining what content is on the page, CSS enhances the visual presentation, and JavaScript interacts with both to dynamically modify content and behavior based on user actions. This trio is essential for creating dynamic, responsive, and interactive web experiences.</p>

            <h2>6).What are some common JavaScript elements, properties, methods, and functions? (provide at least 1 example of each)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Element:</strong> One common JavaScript element is <code>document</code>. For example, 
                    <code>document.getElementById('example')</code> accesses an HTML element with the ID "example".
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Property:</strong> The <code>innerHTML</code> property is used to get or set the HTML content of an element. For instance, 
                    <code>document.getElementById('example').innerHTML = 'Hello World!';</code> changes the HTML content of the specified element to "Hello World!".
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Method:</strong> The <code>addEventListener()</code> method is used to attach an event handler to a specified element without overwriting existing event handlers. You can use it like this:
                    <code>document.getElementById('myBtn').addEventListener('click', function() { alert('Button clicked!'); });</code> This code adds a click event listener to the button with ID "myBtn" that shows an alert when clicked.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Function:</strong> A basic function in JavaScript might be declared to display a message. For example,
                    <code>function displayMessage() { alert('This is a message!'); }</code> defines a function that shows an alert when called.
                </li>
            </ul>
